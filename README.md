# MCPTT iOS App

# Project Setup
1. Fork the repo to your username.
2. Clone the forked repo to your local directory.
3. Add remote upstream
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/arvindsharma024/HCS-iOS
4. Check whether upstream has been added correctly
    git remote -v
5. Take latest pull from upstream develop branch
    git pull upstream develop
    
    
# Branching Strategy
1. Create a branch from develop with either the ticket name or feature name you are working.
2. Make changes to your local branch and commit them, and push them to remote branch with same name.
3. Raise a Pull Request (PR) with your branch targetting upstream develop.

That's it... You are good to go !!
Happy Programming !!
